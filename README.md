# bmDCA Examples

Additional example data from multiple sequence alignment of different protein
families. Split off from the original bmDCA repository, where all the data and
source code were saved together.

The MSA directory contains numerical alignments and sequence weights for a set
of Pfam protein families. You can use these as bmDCA inputs to spare yourself
the time needed to compute the sequence weights.

To download this repository, run:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sudorook/bmDCA-data
```

In the event that you need the full repository, run the above command without
`--depth 1`.
